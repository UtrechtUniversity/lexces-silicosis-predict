#### About this script ####
## Title: Estimation of the impact of outcome misclassification in a
##        pneumoconiosis diagnostic prediction rule
## Author: Javier Mancilla Galindo, LÃ¼tzen Portengen 
## ORCiD: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0718-467X
##
## Purpose: This script follows the procedure described by Zawitowski, et al. 
## https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.7260 to estimate the impact 
## of outcome misclassification in a pneumoconiosis diagnostic prediction rule
## https://oem.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/oem.2006.027904. Available code 
## in Zawitowski's paper was adapted to simulate data compatible with the 
## summary sample data and prediction model equation in the OEM paper.
## A total of 5000 iterations are made to obtain stable mean AUC estimates. 
##
## Note: Functions by Zawitowski, et al. are found elsewhere. This script is
## sourced into the main quarto markdown file (.qmd) after function loading. 
## Refer to README file of repository for instructions on how to use.
