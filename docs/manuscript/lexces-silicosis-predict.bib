abstract = {Background: Construction workers exposed to silica-containing dust are at risk of developing silicosis even at low exposure levels. Health surveillance among these workers is commonly advised but the exact diagnostic work-up is not specified and therefore may result in unnecessary chest x ray investigations. Aim: To develop a simple diagnostic model to estimate the probability of an individual worker having pneumoconiosis from questionnaire and spirometry results, in order to accurately rule out workers without pneumoconiosis. Methods: The study was performed using cross-sectional data of 1291 Dutch natural stone and construction workers with potentially high quartz dust exposure. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed using chest x ray with ILO profusion category ≥=1/1 as the reference standard. The model's calibration was evaluated with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test; the discriminative ability was determined by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC area). Internal validity of the final model was assessed by a bootstrapping procedure. For clinical application, the diagnostic model was transformed into an easy-to-use score chart. Results: Age 40 years or older, current smoker, high-exposure job, working 15 years or longer in the construction industry, "feeling unhealthy" and FEV1 were independent predictors in the diagnostic model. The model showed good calibration (a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow test) and discriminative ability (ROC area 0.81, 95{\%} CI 0.74 to 0.85). Internal validity was reasonable; the optimism corrected ROC area was 0.76. By using a cut-off point with a high negative predictive value the occupational physician can efficiently detect a large proportion of workers with a low probability of having pneumoconiosis and exclude them from unnecessary x ray investigations. Conclusions: This diagnostic model is an efficient and effective instrument to rule out pneumoconiosis among construction workers. Its use in health surveillance among these workers can reduce the number of redundant x ray investigations.},

abstract = {Creating accurate risk prediction models from Big Data resources such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a critical step toward achieving precision medicine. A major challenge in developing these tools is accounting for imperfect aspects of EHR data, particularly the potential for misclassified outcomes. Misclassification, the swapping of case and control outcome labels, is well known to bias effect size estimates for regression prediction models. In this paper, we study the effect of misclassification on accuracy assessment for risk prediction models and find that it leads to bias in the area under the curve (AUC) metric from standard ROC analysis. The extent of the bias is determined by the false positive and false negative misclassification rates as well as disease prevalence. Notably, we show that simply correcting for misclassification while building the prediction model is not sufficient to remove the bias in AUC. We therefore introduce an intuitive misclassification-adjusted ROC procedure that accounts for uncertainty in observed outcomes and produces bias-corrected estimates of the true AUC. The method requires that misclassification rates are either known or can be estimated, quantities typically required for the modeling step. The computational simplicity of our method is a key advantage, making it ideal for efficiently comparing multiple prediction models on very large datasets. Finally, we apply the correction method to a hospitalization prediction model from a cohort of over 1 million patients from the Veterans Health Administrations EHR. Implementations of the ROC correction are provided for Stata and R. Published 2017. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.},

abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence of HRCT findings in construction workers previously surveyed by chest radiographs classified according to ILO guidelines. To examine the association between HRCT findings and exposure to quartz containing dust, and lung function. Methods: The study comprised a questionnaire, dynamic and static lung function measurements, single-breath CO diffusion capacity, chest radiographs and HRCT in 79 individuals. Certified 'B' readers coded radiographs according to the ILO classification. HRCT scans were read according to an international classification system. A qualitative exposure index for cumulative respiratory quartz on a 10-point scale was used. Results: Agreement between HRCT readers was good ($\kappa${\textgreater}0.60), except for irregular opacities ($\kappa$=0.23). In ILO category 0/0, 8{\%} HRCT round, 22{\%} irregular and/or linear opacities and 41{\%} HRCT emphysema was found. HRCT round opacities was associated with high cumulative quartz exposure (OR 7.1; 95{\%} CI 1.3 to 37.8). Emphysema was associated with smoking (OR 10.1; 95{\%} CI 1.2 to 84.2) and showed a reduction in TL,CO,sb. HRCT round opacities was not associated with lung function. Current smoking was negatively associated with FEV1/FVC ratio and positively with RV/TLC ratio, and showed a reduction in TL,CO,sb (13.4{\%}), adjusted for different HRCT findings. Conclusions: Low grade silicosis cannot be excluded in workers with normal chest radiographs (ILO 0/0). In relatively highly exposed construction workers, a sevenfold increased risk of simple (nodular) silicosis was found. Emphysema on HRCT was associated with current or former smokers, but not with exposure, and contributed to reduced diffusion capacity. Airflow limitation was mainly determined by current smoking and was not associated with simple (nodular) silicosis.},

abstract = {Background: Silicosis is one of the oldest occupational lung diseases, but it continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Aims: To report cases of silicosis presenting to two specialist respiratory clinics. Methods: A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of cases of silicosis in workers referred to specialist respiratory clinics. Results: Over the course of 6 years, six cases were identified. The patients were all male with an age range between 24 and 39 years. The duration of silica exposure ranged between 7 and 20 years (mean 13 years). Four cases were entirely asymptomatic at presentation, and two cases described minimal shortness of breath on exertion. Pulmonary function tests were normal in three cases, and a mild restrictive ventilatory defect was documented in the other cases. All had a low apparent predicted probability of pneumoconiosis based on health questionnaires, spirometry and duration of silica exposure. The initial chest X-ray was abnormal in all six cases with radiological evidence of silicosis (International Labour Office profusion category =1/1) on imaging, and all had evidence of silicosis on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Three patients had already progressed to progressive massive fibrosis on HRCT scanning at the time of referral to specialist respiratory services. Conclusions: The appearances of these six cases of silicosis in young, asymptomatic construction workers emphasizes the importance of enforcing effective exposure control and comprehensive surveillance programmes. Our observations highlight the importance of having a low threshold for early radiological screening to promote early and effective detection of this disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of increased micronodule counts in silica dust-exposed smokers. METHODS: We evaluated 54 male smokers with severe silica dust exposure and 54 male control smokers. Both groups underwent low-dose chest computed tomography and lung function testing. Computed tomographic scans were visually evaluated for solid micronodules ({\textless}3 mm). The 95th percentile of micronodule count was calculated for the control smokers. Prevalence of an increased micronodule count was assessed for the dust-exposed subjects. RESULTS: Solid micronodules were present in most participants of both groups. The 95th percentile of micronodule count in the control group was 13. Increased micronodule counts were significantly more common in the exposed group than in the control group (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of silica-exposed heavy smokers evaluated for silicosis have increased micronodule counts on chest computed tomographic scan. This finding might represent an early stage of silicosis.},

abstract = {Objective: Dust containing crystalline silica may cause silicosis, COPD and lung cancer even at low exposure levels. Since no therapy for silicosis is available, early detection is needed to avoid further exposure and progression of the disease. In the Netherlands a national surveillance programme including medical triage has been implemented to identify construction workers with silicosis. For that purpose a diagnostic model has been developed to predict the probability of silicosis by use of a short questionnaire and lung function [1]. In this study medical triage was applied in a ceramic tile production plant.Methods: The diagnostic model was tailored to the company using historical exposure data. Of a total of 391 workers 353 (90{\%}) participated in the study, 52 of whom (15{\%}) had a high risk (sumscore ≥ 5) and were candidate for medical evaluation, including a low-dose high resolution CT-scan of the lungs.Results: 48 of 52 workers (response 92{\%}) were referred for clinical evaluation. Mean age was 52 (±5) yrs, number of pack years 28 (±21). Silicosis was found in 8 workers (17{\%}), another 3 had an increased number of micronodules on CT (6{\%}). In addition, COPD was present in 6 workers (13{\%}): Gold I in 2 (one of whom had silicosis), Gold II in 3 and Gold III in 1 worker.Conclusion: Medical triage followed by specific clinical evaluation in a population of tile plant workers was effective in the early detection of silicosis and yielded a high percentage of COPD. The results stress the need for exposure measures in the tile production industry.References:1. Suarthana E et al. A simple diagnostic model for ruling out pneumoconiosis among construction workers.

abstract = {Introduction: Construction workers exposed to crystalline silica are at risk for developing silicosis, lung cancer and COPD. Since no therapy for silicosis is available, early detection is needed to avoid further progression of the disease by reducing exposure. In collaboration with the Dutch employers and employees organisation for occupational health and safety in the construction industry (Arbouw) a health surveillance programme was implemented.Objective: to identify silicosis in silica exposed construction workers.Methods: a diagnostic model predicting the probability of silicosis was used as a medical triage system based on risk stratification1. Construction workers with a high risk (sumscore ≥ 5) were invited for medical evaluation, including a low-dose high resolution CT-scan of the lungs (HRCT) and spirometry. HRCT was used as the reference standard for silicosis.Results: Of {\&}gt; 75.000 construction workers 1123 (1,5{\%}) were at high risk according to the prediction rule, of whom 295 (response 26{\%}) underwent a clinical investigation. Mean age was 50 (± 6) yrs, number of pack years 26 (± 16). FEV1 was 96 (±16) {\%}pred., FEV1/VC 72 (± 6){\%}. Silicosis was found in 64 workers (22{\%}), 37 (13{\%}) of which in an early stage, corresponding well with the model. HRCT showed numerous other abnormalities including different interstitial patterns, pleural thickening, emphysema and coronary artery calcifications. COPD was present in 62 (21{\%}) workers.Conclusion: silicosis seems still common among silica exposed construction workers, together with co-existing comorbidities.References1.
